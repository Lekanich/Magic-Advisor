It's a plugin for Intellij Idea.

<!-- Plugin description -->
I'm your advisor in hard times. <br/>
When nobody can tell you what to do - I can! <br/>
When nobody is around you - I am near!<br/>
Just ask me.<br/>
But remember I'm just a program and my main reason is to cheer up you and the last decision is only on your shoulders.<br/>

### Usage instruction:

Go to the Menu bar and choose 'Tools' on the menu.<br/>
On the top, you should see the 'Magic Ball' option.<br/>
Ask a question and press the option.<br/>
You can find the answer in the event log in the left bottom.<br/>
Almost the same actions you need to do to get the philosopher's wisdom.<br/>
Choose 'Get Wisdom' option in 'Tools' menu.<br/>
